CMPE232 ‚Äì Tracking and Optimizing Milk Production and Distribution
Course: CMPE 232 ‚Äì Database Systems, TED University
Group: TED CowCode Innovators
Semester: Fall 2024

üìå Project Overview
This project delivers a comprehensive milk supply chain tracking and optimization system. It manages every stage ‚Äî from farm collection to retail shelves ‚Äî ensuring freshness, quality assurance, and operational efficiency.

The system leverages:

Real-time IoT monitoring for temperature & humidity

Automated quality control workflows

Inventory and order management

Route optimization for shipments

Alerts for quality deviations or delivery issues

üóÑ Database Design
Our database is 3NF normalized for integrity and performance.
It models both core entities and complex structures to capture the real-world dynamics of the milk industry.

Main Entities
Entity	Description
Products	Milk product details (name, brand, flavor, pack size, price)
Inventory	Stock levels per warehouse location
Suppliers	Supplier information and linked products
Orders	Customer purchase details
Customers	Customer profiles and loyalty points
Shipments	Delivery tracking for each order
Employees	Staff managing operations

Complex Structures
Weak Entity: PromotionalOffers linked to Products

Aggregation: OrderDetails linking Orders and Products

Hierarchy: Staff as a subtype of Employees

BEGIN
    UPDATE Inventory
    SET QuantityAvailable = QuantityAvailable - NEW.Quantity
    WHERE ProductID = NEW.ProductID;
END;
